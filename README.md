## Initializing hardhat

`yarn init`

`yarn add --dev hardhat`

`yarn hardhat`

- If you are not going to utilize the hardhat-deploy and wish to use a deploy.js script, remember to add to it the following line:

`const {ethers} = require("hardhat")`

- However, if you do want to use hardhat-deploy as a deployment manager, you need to add, as well, the following snippets:
  `yarn add --dev hardhat-deploy`

And then, in the hardhat-config.js, add:
`require("hardhat-deploy")`

Also add the following command to your terminal to overwrite, in your package json,the hardhat-ethers with the hardhat-deploy-ethers package.

`yarn add --dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@npm:hardhat-deploy-ethers ethers`

Finally, add a "deploy" folder to your project, since this is where hardhat will look for when deploying a project.

Remember to number your projects as the following:
"X-deploy-nameofthecontract.js", where X is the order in which it should be compiled.

## Introducing the .env folder

`yarn add --dev dotenv`
Then, add the file .env to the project.
Remember to check if the .gitignore contains it.

After that, in your config file, add:

`require("dotenv)".config();`

To reference them in other files:

`const OBJ = process.env.OBJ;`

And remember to add OBJ to the .env file, like:
`OBJ = something`

## Contract with external imports

If you want to add a package like:
`yarn add --dev @chainlink/contracts`

# Deploying a contract

Code your main async function in your deploy script.
If must be one of these three:

- Easier way:
  `async function main(){
  hre.getNamedAccounts
  hre.deployments
  }
  module.exports.default = deployFunc

- Using anonymous functions and the whole hardhat run environment:
  `module.exports = async (hre) =>{
    const {getNamedAccounts, deployments} = hre;
} 
`

- Using the above with syntatic sugar:
  `module.exports = async({getNamedAccounts, deployments}) => {}`

`yarn hardhat deploy`

## Working with contracts on multiple versions

Go to your config file and set solidity in the module exports as:

`solidity: {
    compilers: [{ version: "0.8.8" }, { version: "0.6.6" }],
  },`

## Deploying your contract in hardhat chain (MockV3Aggregator)

Having imported previously the packages for your smart contract to work (as the following snippet):

`yarn add --dev @chainlink/contracts`

Now, create a folder "test" in the contracts folder. Then, add a file called "MockV3Aggregator.sol"

In it, add some code like this:

`//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`
`pragma solidity ^0.6.0`
`import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";`

To see if your mock needs constructor inputs, go to node-modules and find it in the test folder of the respective contract.

## --> CAUTIONS <--

1. Remember, always, to export the features you wish to import in other files via module.exports = {} in your root file;
2. Don't forget () in functions :3
